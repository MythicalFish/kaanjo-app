      This campaign won't work until you
      %a.white.underline.bold{href:edit_campaign_url(id)} enable it.

  %p.mb2 This is your campaign script:
  %pre
    %code.language-html.mb3= render partial:'campaigns/implementation/script', locals: {cid:@campaign.relative_id}

  %p 
    Note: this script is for this campaign only
    %b= "##{@campaign.relative_id} (#{@campaign.name})"  
    
  %p Place it anywhere in your website's HTML, or include it using Google Tag Manager (recommended if you run multiple campaigns). 

  %p On its own, this script does nothing; it needs to know a few things, namely:
  
  %ul
    %li Your account ID
    %li Your product or article's title
    %li And where to display your emoticons!

  %p 
    This is where the 
    %b div 
    tag comes in:     
  
  %pre
    %code.language-html.mb3
      = render partial:'campaigns/implementation/html'
  %p
    Place it where you'd like the emoticons to display, it should be at least 130px wide, and there should be room to grow vertically a little.
    The emoticons will scale with the width of the container - so if they're too big, simply reduce the width!

  %p 
    You'll also need to insert the name of your product or article in the 
    %span.hl data-name
    attribute. Optionally, you can add the  
    %span.hl data-id
    attribute, just incase you have multiple products with the same name, or if the name of your product or article changes.
